                <h2>Access</h2>
                W3 has produced <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" title="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> in order to make web content more accessible for different people. There are various ways to improve <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility" target="_blank">accessibility</a> in web designs including the following:</p>
            
            <h3>Improve access for text</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Webpage has title that describes topic/purpose</li>
                <li>Use plain language for text, without jargon, idioms, slang, sarcasm, or other complicated terms. Reading level should be lower secondary level.</li>
                <li>Do not justify text and provide ability to resize up to 200%</li>
                <li>Do not center align large blocks of text</li>
                <li>Use decorative fonts sparingly</li>
                <li>Use one h1 heading per page and structure headings in logical sequence</li>
                <li>Headings should be descriptive of topic or purpose</li>
                <li>Use line spacing: at least 1.5 within paragraphs and space between paragraphs is at least 1.5 larger than line spacing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Improve access in interaction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make interactive aspects distinguishable</li>
                <li>Provide context for links and buttons (don't just say "Click Here")</li>
                <li>Don't just rely on shape or colour to indicate interaction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Improve access for visuals</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Use alt text to provide image descriptions</li>
            <li>Test site on different device formats</li>
            <li>Select color combinations with at least 4.5:1 contrast: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer" title="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer" target="_blank">Adobe Color Contrast Checker</a></li>
            <li>Test color contrast and perform accessibility checks: <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html" title="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html" target="_blank">guide for Firefox</a> and <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/designing-for-color-blindness-with-chrome-devtools--cms-35827" title="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/designing-for-color-blindness-with-chrome-devtools--cms-35827" target="_blank">guide for Chrome</a></li>

            <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
    <p>Using what we learned in class and in the labs, make a simple html page that explains Open Source principles. For a refresher on basic page set up refer to this tutorial from W3 Schools on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp" target="_blank">HTML basics</a>.</p>
    <p>Assessment criteria:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>valid html (page loads properly, links work, images load properly)</li>
        <li>explains Open Source principles using relevant sources from class lectures and additional research (make sure to reference sources)</li>
        <li>uses the html elements we learned about so far. Each page <em>must</em> contain: headings, paragraphs, at least one image, list, and at least one link.</li>
        <li>valid <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank">cc license applied</a> and images are properly attributed</li>
        <li>quality of writing: no typos on page, is screen friendly, and references relevant sources.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Upload your html page to Moodle by <span style="color: yellow;"><b>Friday 28 October by 5 pm</b></span>. If you referencing images using relative links (that is, you are including images on your computer rather than on a website), make sure to include image file as well with your submission.</p> 
        <p><strong>Late submission will be penalised.</strong></p>
        <p>We will be working on the pages within class until the assignment is due. If you want to work on your page outside of class, you can use a simple text editor for HTML documents (TextEdit on a Mac or Notepad on a PC) or download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="blank">VSCode</a> on your home computer for free. Do not use a word processor like Microsoft Word, as this will format your text and destroy your file. You can save your assignment to a USB drive or upload to OneDrive in order to access it outside of class. <strong>In general, it is recommended that you back up all your work to <a href="https://maynoothuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>, since files may not be saved correctly on MacLab computers.</strong> You are also welcome to bring your own laptop to class if you prefer to use that.</p>

        <h2>Notes on saving files on Mac Lab Computers</h2>
            <p>Files saved locally to a Mac will only be available on that Mac. So do not save files to the documents folder as previously indicated.</p>
            <p>Ways to save:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Your computer science accounts have a certain amount of storage they can save to, which can be accessed on any machine. This shows as a Network Drive (a little earth icon at the right of the dock).</li> 
                <li>You can also use any file sharing software e.g., onedrive, google drive, dropbox, etc. You all have access to an Office365 student license which includes OneDrive.</li>
                <li>You can also email the file to yourself. Just write an email to your own address and attach the file to this email.</li>
                <li>You can save to a USB or external hard drive, but note that the Windows file format NTFS will not be writable to from a Mac. Your drive will need to be exFAT format to work across Windows and Mac.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Use multiple of the above for saving anything important (ie. save to your Computer Science account AND OneDrive) ðŸ˜Š</p>

            <div class="text2">
                <h2>Preparing assignment for submission</h2>
                <p>Make sure to perform the following checks before submitting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check HTML loads properly</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have included your name and student ID on your page</li>
                    <li>Review code and look for any extra end tags</li>
                    <li>Ensure images load properly</li>
                    <li>Check for access</li>
                    <li>Check all links</li>
                    <li>Valid CC license is applied and all images are attributed</li>
                    <li>Proofread text</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have referenced your sources</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now that you are ready to submit, upload your html file to Moodle. If you are including images using relative links (the image is on your computer and not a URL from the internet), place HTML file and images in folder. Zip this folder and upload zip file to Moodle.</p>
