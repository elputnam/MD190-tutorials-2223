            <h2>Layout with White Space</h2>
            <p>Recall from <a href="tutorial8.html" title="Link to tutorial 8" target="_blank">last week</a> that CSS uses the box model. Every HTML is wrapped in a box with padding, a border, and margin.</p>
            <img src="./images/BoxModel.png" alt="Graphic of CSS box model">
            <p>One effective way to add white space to a website is to manipulate the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">padding</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">margins</a> of an element. These process can involve even distribution of spacing (using one value), or customised differences on all 4 sides.</p>
            <p>Another effective way to layout the page and use white is to use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">div element</a>. The div element functions as a container that is stylised using CSS classes. For instance, on this page, I use the div element to create different coloured bands to space, organise and present content. If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/css/style.css" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">style sheet</a> for this site, you can see how I created the classes "text1" and "text2," which I then call in the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/tutorial9.html" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">HTML tags</a> for the alternating band effect.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Navigation bar</h2>
            <p>A <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="blank">navigation bar</a> can be a useful way to enable visitors to navigate a website. It can be created using a stylised unordered list. You can add links for each of the different sites on your page, add links to relevant external sites (such as social media pages, and/or link to sections within a page. These three applications are demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/tutorial9.html" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">HTML</a> for this page. The links above will be useful for developing your <a href="#assign3">Final Project</a>. You can also make a "sticky" navigation bar, which stays at the top of the window as you scroll down a page. This feature is commented out in the  ruleset for header on the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/css/style.css" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">style sheet</a> for this page.</p>

            <h2>Final Project</h2>
            <p>Using everything that you have learned so far in this MD190 module create a small web site (minimum 3 pages; max 5 pages) that tells the story of you. Keep the tone professional and imagine prospective employers will potentially view this, however at the same time you are trying to help them get to know you so that you stand out from the crowd. Your web site should include optimized imagery as well as text content. Make sure that there are no typos and that you use the correct file formats for web.</p>
            <p>Creativity, thought/effort in developing content, and technical competence are being graded in this assignment.</p>
            <p>To start you should plan your web site by creating a site map. To get inspired you can look up existing similar content online. Keep in mind that developing websites (even mini-websites) take time, including the time required to gather and prepare content. Make sure to give yourself sufficient time to complete the assignment, due <b>Friday 16 December at 5 pm</b>.</p>
            <p>An extended brief, including marking criteria and useful code can be found on <a href="https://moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/login/index.php" title="Link to Moodle" target="_blank">Moodle</a> in the final project assignment brief.</p>
