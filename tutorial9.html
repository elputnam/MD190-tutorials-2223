            <h2>Layout with White Space</h2>
            <p>Recall from <a href="tutorial8.html" title="Link to tutorial 8" target="_blank">last week</a> that CSS uses the box model. Every HTML is wrapped in a box with padding, a border, and margin.</p>
            <img src="./images/BoxModel.png" alt="Graphic of CSS box model" width="400px">
            <p>One effective way to add white space to a website is to manipulate the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">padding</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">margins</a> of an element. These process can involve even distribution of spacing (using one value), or customised differences on all 4 sides (order of values is top, right, bottom, left).</p>
            <!-- Used to demonstrate difference between margin and padding -->
            <p class="margin-display">Margin: 20px</p>
            <p class="padding-display">Padding: 20px</p>
            <p>Another effective way to layout the page and use white is to use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">div element</a>. The div element functions as a container that is stylised using CSS classes. For instance, on this page, I use the div element to create different coloured bands to space, organise and present content. If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/css/style.css" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">style sheet</a> for this site, you can see how I created the classes "text1" and "text2," which I then call in the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/tutorial9.html" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">HTML div tags</a> for the alternating band effect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text2">
            <h2>Navigation bar</h2>
            <p>A <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="blank">navigation bar</a> can be a useful way to enable visitors to navigate a website. It can be created using a stylised unordered list. You can add links for each of the different sites on your page, add links to relevant external sites (such as social media pages, and/or link to sections within a page. These three applications are demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/tutorial9.html" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">HTML</a> for this page. The links above will be useful for developing your <a href="#assign3">Final Project</a>. You can also make a "sticky" navigation bar, which stays at the top of the window as you scroll down a page. This feature is commented out in the  ruleset for header on the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/css/style.css" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">style sheet</a> for this page.</p>

            <h2>Flexbox</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">Flexbox</a> is a technique used to layout content on webpages. It works in one dimension (either as a row or column), unlike <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" blank="_target">grids</a>, which are two dimensional (arrange in rows and columns at the same time). Both flexbox and grids are more advanced CSS techniques that will take time and practice master, but I will briefly touch on flexbox, as this may be useful for laying out content on your site, such as laying out text next to an image.</p>
            <h3>Flexbox Terminology</h3>
            <ul><li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">Flex container</a>: parent element</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_items.asp" title="Link to W3 Schools" target="_blank">Flex items</a>: child elements; elements within the flex container</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In order to use flexbox, a flex container class needs to be defined. Every item within the flex container element will be a flex item (no need to define separately).</p>
            <!-- Flexbox -->
            <div class="container">
                <div><img src="images/Putnam-BurnOn.png"></div>
                <div class="flex-item"><p>Here is an example of a flex box with a container and two items. As you can see it is a useful way to place text next to images. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/css/style.css" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">CSS stylesheet</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/elputnam/MD190-tutorials-2223/blob/main/tutorial9.html" title="Link to GitHub" target="_blank">HTML document</a> for this page to see the code to create this. There are various ways to customise flex boxes; see links above under for different values that can be changed or refer to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox" title="Link to MDN" target="_blank">MDN documents for Flexbox.</a></p></div>

            <h2>Final Project</h2>
            <p>Using everything that you have learned so far in this MD190 module create a small web site (minimum 3 pages; max 5 pages) that tells the story of you. Keep the tone professional and imagine prospective employers will potentially view this, however at the same time you are trying to help them get to know you so that you stand out from the crowd. Your web site should include optimized imagery as well as text content. Make sure that there are no typos and that you use the correct file formats for web.</p>
            <p>Creativity, thought/effort in developing content, and technical competence are being graded in this assignment.</p>
            <p>To start you should plan your web site by creating a site map. To get inspired you can look up existing similar content online. Keep in mind that developing websites (even mini-websites) take time, including the time required to gather and prepare content. Make sure to give yourself sufficient time to complete the assignment, due <b>Friday 16 December at 5 pm</b>.</p>
            <h3>Submission Check List</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Zipped root folder with 3 to 5 web pages, CSS style sheet, and optimised images</li>
                <li>Ensure homepage file name is index.html</li>
                <li>Check that style sheet is properly linked to HTML page</li>
                <li>Check that all links work</li>
                <li>Check that all images are optimised (sized properly and in right format for web) and included in an images folder</li>
                <li>Proofread for spelling and grammar</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An extended brief, including marking criteria and useful code can be found on <a href="https://moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/login/index.php" title="Link to Moodle" target="_blank">Moodle</a> in the final project assignment brief. Refer to the <a href="tutorial8.html" title="Link to CWeek 10 Tutorial" target="_blank">Week 10 Tutorial</a> for steps on setting up a root folder and getting started with the project.</p>
