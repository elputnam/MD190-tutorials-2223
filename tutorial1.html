        <!-- How to include a link: use the <a> tag and href="" attribute, see below for link to Code Academy -->
        <p>From <a style="color:cyan;" href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/intro-to-html/exercises/anatomy-html" target="_blank"> CodeAcademy.com</a>: HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.
        <!-- How to include an image: use the <img> tag and source attribute -->
        <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/html%20lesson%20image.svg" alt="HTML design diagram" style="width:600px;height:200px;">
            <!-- How to create an unordered list (list with bullet points). Notice how each list item is presented within <li> tags -->
            <ul>
                <li> HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket. </li>
                <li> Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.</li>
                <li> Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.</li>
                <li> Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 style="color:yellow;">Hello World!</h2>
        <p>Now is it is time to make your first website!</p>
        <!-- How to create an ordered list (numerical list). As with the unordered list, each list item must be placed within <li> tags -->
            <ol>
                <li>Create a <span style="color: red;">folder</span> in your computer science account drive (see below notes on saving).</li>
                <li>Open up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) in applications.</li>
                <li>Select "Open Folder" and open your folder.</li>
                <li>Create a new html document and save as index.html</li>
                <li>Copy this text and past into your document:</li>
                
                    <br>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    <br>&lt;html&gt;
                    <br><br>&lt;head&gt;
                    <br><br>&lt;/body&gt;
                    <br><br>&lt;body&gt;
                    <br>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Look at me code!&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/body&gt;<br><br>&lt;/html&gt;<br><br>
      
        <li>Check out what your page looks like in the browser. Find the file in your document folder and double click to open in web browser.</li> 
            </ol>
            <h2>Notes on saving files on Mac Lab Computers</h2>

            <p>Files saved locally to a Mac will only be available on that Mac. So do not save files to the documents folder as previously indicated.</p>

            <p>Ways to save:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Your computer science accounts have a certain amount of storage they can save to, which can be accessed on any machine. This shows as a Network Drive (a little earth icon at the right of the dock).</li> 
                <li>You can also use any file sharing software e.g., onedrive, google drive, dropbox, etc. You all have access to an Office365 student license which includes OneDrive.</li>
                <li>You can also email the file to yourself. Just write an email to your own address and attach the file to this email.</li>
                <li>You can save to a USB or external hard drive, but note that the Windows file format NTFS will not be writable to from a Mac. Your drive will need to be exFAT format to work across Windows and Mac.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Use multiple of the above for saving anything important (ie. save to your Computer Science account AND OneDrive) 😊</p>
        <h2 style="color:yellow">Experiment!</h2>
        <p style="color:white">Now play around with your code. Add different headings and paragraphs. Try to add a list. Is there something you want to do that is not translating onto the page? </p>
