            <br>3. Select "Open Folder" and open your folder
            <br>4. Create a new html document and save as index.html
            <br>5. Copy this text and past into your document:
            
                <br><br>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                <br>&lt;html&gt;
                <br>&lt;body&gt;
                <br><br>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;Look at me code!&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>
                &lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;
        </p>
        <p>Check out what your page looks like in the browser. Find the file in your document folder and double click to open in web browser.</p> 
        <h2 style="color:yellow">Experiment!</h2>
        <p style="color:white">Now play around with your code. Add different headings and paragraphs. Is there something you want to do that is not translating onto the page? </p>
