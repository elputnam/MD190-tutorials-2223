        <h1>Welcome to the second MD190[A] HTML tutorial!</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This week we are going to continue learning the fundamentals of HTML5 with a focus on page layout. We are also going to start work on assignment one, which is due <span style="color: cyan;"><b>Friday 28 October by 5 pm</b></span>.</p>
        <h2>Recap</h2>
        <p>Last week we covered the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML elements, including headings, paragraphs and lists</li>
            <li>Setting up an HTML document</li>
            <li>Inspecting page source on a web browser</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp">Inline Style,</a> such as adding colors</li>
            <li>Adding links</li>
            <li>Adding images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't worry if you cannot remember the specific tags, terms, and syntax to use. This is normal. It is common to need to look up specifics in a reference guide or cheatsheet. The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">W3 Schools HTML Basics</a> page provides a great summary. We will also review these again this week.</p>

        <h2>HTML Page Layout</h2>
        <p>The layout of a simple HTML document is as follows:</p>
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            <br>&lt;html&gt;
            <br><br>&lt;body&gt;
            <br>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
            <br>&lt;p&gt;Look at me code!&lt;/p&gt;<br>
            &lt;/body&gt;<br><br>&lt;/html&gt;<br><br></code>
        <p>Elements are nested, so think of them as nesting dolls, as presented in this graphic from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp"></a><br><br><img src="./images/html-page-structure.png" width="500"></p>
        <p>Remember that HTML5 is hierarchical, which means content is organised as headings (h1 - h6) and paragraphs. These are indicated through tags. Some tags require start and end tags. Make sure to remember end tags. A code editor, like VSCode, may automatically create end tags, so pay attention that you don't accidentally have too many. Other tags like &lt;br&gt; and &lt;img&gt; are empty elements, which have no content and do not have end tags.</p>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed that when creating links or embedding images, you need to add information to the tag to indicate where to get or direct the relevant content. These are called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp" target="blank">attributes</a>. The &lt;a&gt; is used to create hyperlinks, but your need to include the href attribute to indicate where the hyperlink goes to. These are always included in the start tag and generally come as name/value pairs, or as <strong>name="value"</strong></p>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>Set up a new HTML document. Title it week2.html and save it in the folder you created last week. We are going to use this to test out different attributes.</p>
        <p>Test your skills with these <a title="W3 Schools" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_exercises.asp">exercises from W3 Schools</a>. Go as far as you feel comfortable.</p> 
        <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
        <p>Using what we learned in class and in the labs, make a simple html page.</p>
        <p>Assessment criteria:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>valid html (page loads properly)</li>
            <li>explains Open Source principles using relevant sources from class lectures and additional research</li>
            <li>uses the html elements we learned about so far. Each page <em>must</em> contain: headings, paragraphs, at least one image, list, and at least one link.</li>
            <li>valid cc license applied</li>
            <li>quality of writing: no typos on page and is screen friendly.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Upload your html page to Moodle by <span style="color: cyan;"><b>Friday 28 October by 5 pm</b></span>. If you referencing images using relative links, make sure to include images as well.</p> 
            <p><strong>Late submission will be penalised.</strong></p>
